    <h2>Modified JDT Core for AspectJ</h2>

    <p>There are four kinds of changes made to the jdt.core sources.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Things that are completely broken from an extensibility point of view.
	Serious design work is needed on these before we'd even want to propose changes to 
	the jdt.core main branch.

      </li>
      <li>Visibility, finalness of methods/fields changed for extensibility.</li>
      <li>Additional extension hooks added to several classes.  Need to ensure there is no major performance hit, and that these designs are fairly clean.</li>
      <li>Whole question of what is the API of the compiler.  Currently, many internal classes are used and extended.  It would sure be nice to solve the practical problems in 1-3 before addressing this important question.</li>
    </ol>
